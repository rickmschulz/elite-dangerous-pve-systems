## Introduction

Pirate massacre missions can be a terrific source of income in Elite Dangerous when using the right strategy, but it can be a hassle to accomplish. 

I often see myself struggling to find the best sources/target systems for stacking massacre missions effectively as it can consume a lot of time to search for them, even with this amazing tool [edtools PVE missions systems](https://edtools.cc/pve).

So, i found a way to speed up the proccess to search pirate massacre missions daily.

## Comprehension 

I'm sure some of you are asking "What means sources/target systems?" and the mechanics behind massacre missions. All you need to know about them is explained in this amazing post [PSA: A tool for finding good sources of PVE "Massacre pirates" missions](https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/hpzmox/psa_a_tool_for_finding_good_sources_of_pve/) by [u/cold-n-sour](https://www.reddit.com/user/cold-n-sour/).

**Note:** Minor faction states like war, election or civil war are great enemies of pirate massacre mission givers. 

**Edit:** This video explains and gives some tips about *pirate massacre mission stacking*:

## How it Works

The **tool** is a *google spreadsheet* that gathers information about the best (criteria bellow) sources/target systems with [edtools PVE missions systems](https://edtools.cc/pve), that i could find, for doing massacre missions nearest *System Sol*. 

Criteria for the best sources/target systems:

* Two systems sources, one target system.
* Minor factions in source systems **cannot** be in state of war, election or civil war.
* Sources systems must have at least 12 unique factions.
* All source systems must have large landing pad and distance to nearest station 3000ls maximum.

The tool analyzes data from [edtools PVE missions systems](https://edtools.cc/pve) and [INARA](https://inara.cz/elite/starsystems/). It's flow action is presented bellow:

* Gathers information about sources/target systems with [edtools PVE missions systems](https://edtools.cc/pve).
* Analyzes every single source system, every day, at 8:00 UTC, 14:00 UTC and 20:00 UTC, with [INARA](https://inara.cz/elite/starsystems/).
* Investigate minor factions for the presence of state of war, election or civil war.
* Compilate all information to the [Spreadsheet Tool](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PCTz1hLz3UxeiQT1MsrIKjZeRZTbJL_xn2ij0vpMu6A/edit?usp=sharing).

## How to Use It

1. Open the [Spreadsheet Tool](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PCTz1hLz3UxeiQT1MsrIKjZeRZTbJL_xn2ij0vpMu6A/edit?usp=sharing).

2. Examine the spreadsheet and pick Target/Sources systems that **do not** have "war, election or civil war detected" in the INARA column.

3. Then, go to the *edtool URL link* in the same row and get the hands dirty! 

The column *"Factions Updated Time"* shows when INARA updated minor factions.

The spreadsheet has *conditional formatting*, so, choose sources/target systems with bold text in the rows. 

## TL;DR

To wrap it all up, a good tool to find good systems and do some pirate massacre missions.
